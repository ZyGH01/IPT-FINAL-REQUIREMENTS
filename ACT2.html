    <h2 style="background-color:red;">Google</h2>
    <h2 style="background-color:red;"> First and foremost, without this website, everything including my extra knowledge would not be aquired by me. Google has helped me a lot in especially in terms of being a better person. Also, Goole provides value oriented features so that anyone even from other races can enjoy its reliability. However, Not everything in google is realiable as it is just a search engine and the contents it has depends on the creators of the contents. On the other hand, it is good to use and is somehow helpful. For me, not being the bestt compared to duckduckgo and bing, but google works too so if I have to choose, I will definitely choose google.</h2>
